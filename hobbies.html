    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p> 
        It's the fun of building an application(the result is what matters). 
        For others, it's the process of creating something that works. Coding can be very engaging. 
        Each line of code, if it works, causes something to happen.
